Logistic Regression:
In statistics, the logistic model (or logit model) is a statistical model that models the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds for the event 
be a linear combination of one or more independent variables. Formally, in binary logistic regression there is a single binary dependent variable, coded by an indicator 
variable, where the two values are labeled "0" and "1", while the independent variables can each be a binary variable (two classes, coded by an indicator variable) or a 
continuous variable (any real value). The corresponding probability of the value labeled "1" can vary between 0 (certainly the value "0") and 1 (certainly the value "1"), 
hence the labeling; the function that converts log-odds to probability is the logistic function, hence the name.

Confusion matrix :
A confusion matrix is a table that is used to define the performance of a classification algorithm. A confusion matrix visualizes and summarizes the performance of a 
classification algorithm. It canâ€™t be created for linear regression. The confusion matrix is used for model evaluation.

Logistic linear regression is supervised machine learning algorithm. which is use to find the relationship between more than one independent variable and one dependent 
variable. The data-set contain 2 variable one is dependent which is pclass, age, gender, sibsp & parch and the other is survived. So with the help of these data we have
to predict the survival chance of passenger based on the passenger class, age, gender, sibsp and parch.
